            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The conſideration hereof inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me (one moſt vnfit) to aduenture the tranſplanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this pretious exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke root, into our owne ſoile.

Plainneſſe is my ambition, elſe needed not theſe little marginall illuſtrations on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſatisfie a meere Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Reader.

<pb facs="tcp:15059:5"/>meaning.</p>
            <p>As in the word <hi>Caeſar,</hi> with the Author vſes for Emperor, almoſt through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the booke.

Therefore I haue briefly runne ouer the <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> or <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, becauſe it muſt be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bounded within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of holy Scriptures; but the other three that follow, are very famous by many Authors workes; eſpecially
<pb facs="tcp:15059:9"/>the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which writers, thoſe (of the <hi>Greeks</hi>) challenge the firſt rank, <hi>Herodotus, Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidides, Zenophon</hi> and <hi>Polybius:</hi> for thoſe other that <hi>Cicero</hi> mentions, <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recides, Hellanicus, Acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filas, Phylliſtus, Agatho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clis, Theopompus, Epho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, Caliſthenes, Timaeus, Clitarchus, Silenus,</hi> are loſt: as alſo thoſe <hi>Latines</hi> that wrote the ancient <hi>Romane</hi> hiſtorie, whom the ſame <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> nominates, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Pontifies Annals, Fabius Pictor, Marcus Portius Cato, Lucius Piſo, Caeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Antipater, Caius Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, Vennonius, Clodius, Aſiſo, Accius, Lucius Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenna.</hi> And thoſe indeed
<pb facs="tcp:15059:9"/>were the Authors, out of whom, <hi>Titus Liuius,</hi> who is better halfe diſmembred, and before him, <hi>Saluſt,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect alſo, collected their workes. <hi>Cicero</hi> indeed vſed not this kind of writing, but was moſt ſtudiouſly verſt in it, as his Bookes witneſſe, which are euery where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſprinkled and inameled with remembrances of all antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: but hee was a moſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent obſeruer of the courſe of times, ſo as by him, one may attaine to the orderly know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge both of perſons, ages, and the times of accidents. For otherwiſe all writings are obſcure: and becauſe hee was wont to ſay, that the writings of hiſtories (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally after the <hi>Greek</hi> faſhion)
<pb facs="tcp:15059:10"/>was very much Oratoricall: therefore <hi>Pomponius Atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> counſailed him to this kinde of writing, complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that hiſtorie ſtood in need of the Latine tongue: and alledging, that hee was able to effect that, which, euen in this kinde of writing alſo, would make <hi>Rome</hi> not inferiour to <hi>Greece.</hi> So hee writ a Commentarie of his Conſulſhip in <hi>Greeke,</hi> and begunne another in Latine, as he ſaith himſelfe. For hee was very deſirous to haue that yeare, wherein hee was Conſull, celebrated by other mens pennes: inſomuch that he profeſſed, that if they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare him, he would not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare himſelfe, but would write concerning himſelfe.
<pb facs="tcp:15059:10"/>
               <hi>Caius Caeſar</hi> onely, writes of his own exploits, and bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed nothing from any of thoſe before him. Then alſo flouriſht <hi>Diodorus</hi> of <hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> and a little after, <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſius</hi> of <hi>Halicarnaſſus:</hi> then <hi>Plutarch, Suetonius, Cornelius Tacitus, Appi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus, Herodianus, Trogus Pompeius, Aelianus, Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Curtius:</hi> but many of thoſe are either wholly, or the greater part of them loſt. After thoſe, many more fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, who (each one conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing the hiſtorie of his time, or of his Country) held on, euen till within our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie. And we muſt be ſeene in all thoſe, or at leaſt a good part of them, to furniſh our ſelues with that abilitie
<pb facs="tcp:15059:11"/>which is required. Some alſo we muſt read for the matter it ſelfe; others, for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, together with the ſtile and form of ſpeech. In which ranke, <hi>Caius Caeſar</hi> alone, iuſtly challenges precedency among the Latines: for none are more pure, none more ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant then his: who for a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable ſtyle, farre excelled not only thoſe that came not long after him, but alſo all of his time. Beſides thoſe before mentioned, we muſt likewiſe turne ouer ſuch Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Authors, as treat of the conuerſion of Religion, the afflictions of the godly, or the lawes and decrees of Councels and Biſhops. And becauſe the holy Scriptures foreſhew the Papall king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb facs="tcp:15059:11"/>wee muſt ſearch out the beginning, together with the progreſſe and increaſe thereof; thereby to inable our ſelues, to compare it with thoſe marks and ſigns which the Scripture hath chalkt out. But becauſe this large argument which wee haue propounded, is various, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold, and comberſome, and this field ſo exceeding ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, not to bee gone ouer in any ſhort time: ſome nearer way muſt be taken, by a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodicall courſe, for the help of yonger Students: as for thoſe of deeper experience, they may well enough by themſelues, as they ſay, ſwim ouer the whole ſtreame of Writers. And for this end haue I vndertaken this task,
<pb facs="tcp:15059:12"/>that the Neoterie may haue a tract and path-way leading to their further learning, by which in the meane time they may trace, as by a line, till they bee growne riper ſchollers, and come to that proficiency, as to bee able to caſt away and deſpiſe thoſe rudiments. For I haue not writ this, that they ſhould be content with, or confine themſelues to theſe bounds, but to giue them a taſt of their future reading: when being inuited by variety of matter, they may bee more ſpurred on, hereafter to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate the Authors and Bookes themſelues, from whence theſe are culled. But this kinde of ſtudie properly appertaining to thoſe, that
<pb facs="tcp:15059:12"/>are appointed to the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a people, as I ſaid before, I ſuppoſe (moſt Noble Duke) I ſhall not miſapply, to your age and condition, in offring vp thoſe my ſmall watch work<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s to your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: ſo that by you, and through your hands as I may ſo ſay, the reſidue of yonger Students may receiue ſome fruit thereof, if any may redound from thence. And albeit, thoſe moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy men, your Tutors, <hi>Iohn Sigiſmund</hi> and <hi>Sebaſtian Cox,</hi> vſe their beſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence about your inſtruction and erudition: yet as in the culture of a little garden plot, which we deſire to haue exquiſite and arraied with all kind of flowers, we ſcorne
<pb facs="tcp:15059:13"/>not any little plants &amp; herbs brought vs from another ground; ſo likewiſe I hope this ſmall preſent of mine, ſent to the manuring of the ſeed-plot of your learning, will not be inacceptable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but onely offred vp for a time, tilyou your ſelf, hauing gotten ſtrength, as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, be able to walke abroad, and courſe vp &amp; down theſe open fields &amp; flowrie meads. For which courſe, you haue that moſt renowned Prince, your Fathers vertue, for a reſplendent patterne: who by his elegant learning, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded no ſmall ornament and luſtre to his Noble birth; and that which is all in all, hee made right vſe of this his facultie: to wit, that the
<pb facs="tcp:15059:13"/>name of God ſhould bee cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated, Churches &amp; Schools well ordered, godly teachers prouided for, and a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie allowed for mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Schollers. For this dutie God chiefly requires at the hands of you Princes; and as he ſeuerely puniſheth the neglect thereof, ſo alſo he remunerates, thoſe with moſt bountiful rewards, that ſhew themſelues faithfull Stewards herein. Thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of your illuſtrious Fathers pietie, conſtancie, and fortitude, might bee mentioned by name: but you will read them in good time hereafter, imblazoned at large, &amp; ſhall know the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ornaments of Nobilitie. For hee that is benigne to
<pb facs="tcp:15059:14"/>good wits, how can it be, that hee ſhould not at one time or other, be repaied by them, with the deſcrued fruits of gratitude, and bee celebrated to poſteritie? Therefore vnderſtanding both the dignitie of his place, and the charge laid vpon him by God; hee made it his chiefe care to haue your minde trained vp to godlineſſe and learning, euen from your young and tender yeeres. And that which is the feeling pulſe of a Fathers loue, nothing euer ioyd him more, then to ſee his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion bettered by your indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie. And I doubt not of your owne voluntary propenſion that way (as much as your age can beare) and your Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
<pb facs="tcp:15059:14"/>their diligent vigilan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. Wherefore Illuſtrious Prince, proceed auſpiciouſly, and as you are borne to the gouernement of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, ſo furniſh your ſelfe with ſuch ammunition, as is both perpetuall, and will affoord infallible aid: and not onely extenuate the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, which you muſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times vndergoe in gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning an ancient Prouince, but alſo make it eaſie and pleaſant.</p>

               <p>As for the originall of <hi>Rome,</hi> it was but meane and in a manner contemptible, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath ſo ordained as afterwards it ſhall be declared: it grew vp to the height of potency.

Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:15059:38"/>expell'd their Kings, the gouernment of their State was tranſlated to two Conſuls, whoſe office was annuall. The firſt was <hi>Lucius Iunius Brutus,</hi> one no leſſe vehement and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent about expulſion of the Kings, and ſetting vp the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Countrey: then vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant and valiant in preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof. For when his owne two ſonnes, <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Tiberius,</hi> amongſt other No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemens ſonnes of <hi>Rome,</hi> had commun'd together in priuate conſultations, about calling in againe of the <hi>Tarquins:</hi> after the matter was openly diſclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, he put them to open death Hee alſo abrogated his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legue <hi>Tarquinius Collatinus</hi> his authority, who was his aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate in expelling of the Kings, as alſo coadiutor in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells. <hi>Cicero</hi> defends this fact as iuſt, and ſaith it was no leſſe profitable then honourable to

                  <hi>Fabies</hi> marched out of the Citie againſt the enemie, and were all ſlaine, ſauing a childe which was left at home, and ſo left aliue: who afterwards raiſed the houſe againe: this happened in the thirty three yeere after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion of the Kings. By rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the troubleſome ſtate of the Common-wealth, Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours were ſent into <hi>Greece,</hi> in the three hundred yeere after the building of the Citie, to fetch from thence, the lawes, which the Citie of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould vſe.

                  <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virs</hi> were put in authoritie with the gouernement therof, but this order held not full three yeeres: for <hi>Appius Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> one of the <hi>Decemvirs,</hi> by his lewdneſſe in violently car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying away a Virgin, daughter to <hi>Lucius Virginius,</hi> a Citizen of <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſerue his luſt: gaue occaſion to the people wholly to ſubuert this order. So the gouernement returned to the Conſuls, but thoſe two, held it but a few yeeres: and then two
<note n="ſ" place="margin">Much like our Knight Marſhals at this day.</note> Tribunes of the Soldiers were conſtituted with Conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar authoritie: but they before their yeere was out, left off their office, and made roome againe for the Conſuls: and at this time, which was in the three hundred &amp; fifteenth yeer of <hi>Rome</hi> built, <hi>Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus</hi> the Dictator, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Caius Seruilius Hala,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Cauallery, to kill

The fourth day ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing admittance, the Pope propounds to him theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions: that hee ſhould ſtand to his iudgement, anſwer the Princes their accuſation, and if conuicted, leaue his Empire, and neuer afterwards attempt any reuenge: in the meane time liue as a priuate man, and not meddle in any publike affaires, releaſe his ſubiects from their loyaltie and oath: remoue from him his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors and familiars: in caſe hee ſhall doe any thing to the contrary, that benefit now
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:15059:161"/>granted him to become void, and the Princes to haue free li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, preſently thereupon to chooſe them another. When the Emperour had approoued of theſe conditions, the Pope ſaies Maſſe, and to purge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from all pretended crime, takes the vnleauened bread, which they call the <hi>Lords Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> inuocating fearefull exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations vpon his owne head and eſtate, if all theſe troubles were not wrought by his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries: and then he exhorts the Emperour (if he thought the crimes obiected againſt him by the Princes, were falſe, or any iniury offered him) to doe the like, and take the other part of the conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted bread: but hee excuſed himſelfe, ſhewing that hee could not conueniently doe it, and the Pope vrged him no further, but entertained him with a banquet, and ſo cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly

In him (being the Patron of Iuſtice, the Altar and Bulwarke of lawes) they had grounded all their hopes, and had not onely contemned the excommunication, but alſo for his ſake affronted the Pope in bitter enmitie: and now, for him, by this, directly the moſt diſhonourable of examples, to brand the Empire to all poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, with this ſo deepe and indelible infamie, and come in fauour againe with him, the publike enemie both to Church &amp; Common-wealth.

               <p>The Emperour herewith acquainted, ſaw no meanes likelier to pacifie them, then by fleeing from the league, and ioyning with them; which fact quite confounded the Popes plots, inſomuch as hee was inforced to breake off his intended iourney into <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie.</hi> And which was next to be done, by his Legates, ſignifies to the Princes of <hi>Germanie;</hi> how matters ſtood, and withal exhorts them to haue a care of the Common-wealth. This was in the yeere, 1077.</p>
               <p>They therefore create <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolphus,</hi> Duke of <hi>Sueuia,</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, whom the Archbiſhop of <hi>Mentz</hi> conſecrates.

<pb n="357" facs="tcp:15059:193"/>bound to them.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Cities there of any ſtrength, either haue their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Lords, or elſe are ſwayed by factions, and hauing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all to doe with vs. Now for the <hi>Venetians</hi> what a company hold they, not onely of goodly Cities, and freebur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, but alſo Prouinces: they themſelues in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim, being an abſolute free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and quite ſeparated from the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire. As for <hi>Inſubria,</hi> commonly called <hi>Lombardy,</hi> that indeed belongs ſomewhat nearer to vs: but it totters too, neither receiue wee any certaine profit from thence. For after that our Emperours had, as aboueſaid, firſt conſtituted Viſcounts there, as they call them, and afterwards Dukes, how miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably was it rent to peeces, and euer ſince that time how little did it benefit vs? For our
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:15059:194"/>Emperours neglecting it in time of the warres there, the houſe of the <hi>Sfortia's</hi> diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing the <hi>Vicounts,</hi> ſeized vpon it, whom afterwards <hi>Lewis</hi> the XII. and <hi>Francis</hi> the I. Kings of <hi>France,</hi> excluded; the latter whereof held it for ſixe yeeres, till the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the V. recouered it.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee, no reuenues come from any part of <hi>Italie,</hi> for they neither repaire to our Diets, nor contribute any thing at all to any publike vſe or neceſſitie, but what they doe voluntarily, or in fauour to the Emperour: onely <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie</hi> remaines, which alwaies repugned the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire, ſcarce euer free from rebellion, as before appears, till at length it was gathered together by the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, and reduced into one body: after which time, when the power of electing the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:15059:194"/>was committed to the ſeuen Electors, as we haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſhewed, it became the Emperours Court and Manſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on place. And here too wee muſt conſider, with what dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie this little diminitiue body of the Empire, congea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in <hi>Germanie,</hi> could incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate it ſelf: for when were we euer free from iarres and ciuill broiles? So now whatſoeuer goes vnder the name of the Empire, is incuded within the bounds of <hi>Germany,</hi> for all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne places, and thoſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the compaſſe thereof, are fallen away. Howbeit we ſee there are many, euen within thoſe ſmall compaſt limits, that flie backe, and as much as they can, withdraw themſelues and their countries forth of the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of the Empire. I paſſe ouer in ſilence thoſe neighbouring Kings and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes, that day by day
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:15059:195"/>catch &amp; ſnatch away, as much as they can from this feeble and ſapleſſe little body, which ſcarce cleaues to the bones: ſtriuing to bring that into their owne dominions, which belonged to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
               <p>But to come to an end in ſome time, let vs lend our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to <hi>Daniels</hi> prophecie, concerning all that is ſpoken. We haue treated of the Image that <hi>Nabuchodonozar</hi> ſaw in his dreame, whereto wee will returne againe; but in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim, take a view of ſome other places. In his VII. Chap. he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the foure beaſts, which in a dream he ſaw co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming out of the Sea: A Lyon, a Beare, a Leopard, and the fourth and laſt, he ſaies, was terrible and dreadfull to behold. The Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſignifies the kingdome of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> the two wings which he had, are as it were the two
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:15059:195"/>members of that Empire, <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> and <hi>Aſſyria.</hi> By the Beare is vnderſtood the kingdome of <hi>Perſia,</hi> by which <hi>Babylon</hi> was conquered: the three ribs which hee ſaies were in his mouth betwixt his teeth, are the three chiefe Kings of that Monarchie, <hi>Cyrus, Darius</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> who were more famous then the reſt, and eate much fleſh as he ſpeakes, that is, brought many nations in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their ſubiection.</p>
               <p>The Leopard is <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, or the Greeke Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; his foure wings &amp; heads, are the foure kingdomes which riſe out of that Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, after <hi>Alexanders</hi> death. The fourth and laſt Beaſt is the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire: the tenne hornes are his members or Prouinces, ſuch as were <hi>Syria, Aegypt, Aſia, Greece, Affricke, Spaine, Gallia, Italie, Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, Brittaine:</hi> for all thoſe
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:15059:196"/>they held.</p>
               <p>Now a certaine little horne, grew vp and ſhot forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the tenne hornes, which pluckt away three hornes from thoſe ten. This notifies the kingdome of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> or the Turke, which from a ſmall beginning, bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding forth of the <hi>Romane</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, ſeized vpon three of the chiefeſt parts thereof, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Greece.</hi> Further this little horne hath eyes, and was reproachfull againſt God: For <hi>Mahomet</hi> vented a new kinde of doctrine, which was well liked of by his followers, as carrying ſome ſhew of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in it. Thoſe are the eyes, but indeed hee blaſphemes God. For hee aboliſhes the Bookes of the Prophets and Apoſtles, and acknowledges no benefit by Chriſt, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfully railes againſt all doctrine concerning Chriſt.
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:15059:196"/>Further, that little horne, ſaith he, ſhall make warre with the Saints, and ſore afflict them, till the Ancient of daies ſhall come to iudgement, who hath neither beginning nor end: whereby it clearely appeares, that within the time of this Empire, the tearme of this world ſhall haue an end, and ſhall neuer be againe: but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the diſſolution of all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Principalities, then ſhall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that perpetual kingdome, whereof Chriſt ſhall be Prince and Head.</p>
               <p>In his eight chapter, the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> deſcribes the Ramme and the Goat, which the Angell afterwards plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interprets, ſaying, the Ram with two hornes, betokens the Kings of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi> and the Goat, the Greeke Empire, and the great horne in his forehead, the firſt king of that Empire: and that foure
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:15059:197"/>hornes ſucceeded after that horne was broken; it ſignifies, ſaith he, that foure kingdomes ſhall riſe out of that Empire, but not to bee compared to that firſt King for ſtrength and puiſſance.</p>
               <p>Here we may ſee how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and infallibly the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Daniel</hi> portraies <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the Great, two hundred yeeres and more before his raigne. For it ſhall ſo fall out, ſaith hee, that the Goat ſhall not touch the earth; that is, he ſhould runne ouer his warres with exceeding celeritie, and no man ſhould be able to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Ramme out of his hand: for <hi>Alexander</hi> raigned onely twelue yeeres, in which little inch of time, hee almoſt ſubdued all <hi>Aſia,</hi> as wee haue aboue ſhewed. And though the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> were of incredible ſtrength, yet in three ſet battels, <hi>Darius</hi> was
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:15059:197"/>ouerthrowne, and loſt his life and his Empire both at once.</p>
               <p>Many write, that when <hi>Alexander</hi> came to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> the High-Prieſt read that place of <hi>Daniel</hi> to him, which exceedingly reioyced him.</p>
               <p>Againe, that another horne ſhould riſe from amongſt thoſe foure hornes, at firſt but ſmall, but afterwards very po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull, which ſhould grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly oppreſſe the Sanctuary: herely ſaith hee, hee foretells thoſe moſt bitter perſecutions which the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſhould ſuffer vnder <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great his ſucceſſors, the Kings of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> betwixt whom the Country of <hi>Iudea</hi> lies: For the <hi>Iewes</hi> haue felt that horne which roſe out of the foure hornes, in <hi>Antiochus Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> King of <hi>Syria,</hi> that moſt cruell deſtroier.</p>
               <p>Hither alſo, we muſt apply the eleuenth chapter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:15059:198"/>he ſpeakes againe of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the Great, and ſo copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and properly, that it may rather ſeeme an Hiſtorie, then a Prophecie.</p>
               <p>But now again let vs return to <hi>Nabuchodonozors</hi> Image, whereof, vpon occaſion, wee ſpoke in our firſt booke; as for the interpretation thereof, concerning the three firſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies, I will not repeat it, becauſe it is both per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, as alſo made good by the times themſelues, onely we will ſpeake ſomething of the fourth, becauſe it both properly appertaines vnto vs, who liue in it, and is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly deſcribed by <hi>Daniel: It ſhall be of iron,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>which ſhall breake in pieces, and bring all the reſt of the Monarchies in ſubiection to it:</hi> there needs not many words in explanation hereof; for the matter it ſelfe ſpeakes, and it manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:15059:198"/>out of the hiſtorie of thoſe Monarchs which wee haue reckoned vp.</p>
               <p>But the Images feet, and the toes of the feet, are part of iron, part of potters clay. As the foot of a mans body is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into toes, ſo the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire, after it hath for a while continued ſtrong, being ſupported by iron legges, and incircled the whole world in its circumference; ſhall fall into toes, and that maſſie body ſhall be diſſolued. This alſo is plainely effected, and needs no explication: for at this day, what is more diuided then the body of that moſt ſpacious Empire? And though the caſe thus ſtand, yet becauſe the ſole of the foot is of iron, the foundation ſhall remaine, and ſhall neuer bee extinguiſhed, but the reliques, title, and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie thereof ſhall endere till Chriſt at his comming ſhall ſet
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:15059:199"/>a period to all humane things, but it is cleare as noone day, and beyond all doubt, that it is now at the loweſt ebbe.</p>
               <p>That goodly tree is fallen, but the root ſtickes faſt, and remaines yet, not hauing any ſappe, and therefore vnable to grow vp, and increaſe againe: but quite dead and withered, yet no force of man ſhall bee able vtterly to extirpate this roote, and foot-ſoale of iron nature, but it ſhall ſticke faſt grounded in the earth, till the whole world ſhall be deſtroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Hereof alſo wee haue had experience, for many haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten attempted the ſubuerſion of this ſmall and ſlender parcel of the Empire, as the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> and laſtly the Turkes: who though they haue done great matters, and it may bee promiſe greater to themſelues; yet they ſhall not make vp ſuch a maſſie bodie, as may
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:15059:199"/>hold compariſon with the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſance of the <hi>Romanes:</hi> nether ſhall they ſubuert this ſeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plot of the Empire which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, though it be both drie and withered: nor can any fift Monarchie be raiſed.</p>
               <p>Though <hi>Germanie</hi> onely hath the title and poſſeſſion of the Empire, yet if it would ioyne hearts and hands, it might eaſily expell all forraign force, as may be prooued by many arguments.</p>
               <p>The Turkes of late yeeres haue runne in very farre vpon vs, and after the winning of
<note n="a" place="margin">The ſtreight wherupon <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> ſtands in that part diuiding <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> being not aboue 7. miles <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

But if wee looke a little nearer into <hi>Daniel,</hi> it is to bee
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:15059:200"/>hoped, that their power and greatneſſe is now at its full height. For <hi>Daniel</hi> giues them onely three hornes, as wee haue before recited, which they now haue, being firſt of all made Lords of all <hi>Aſia,</hi> then of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Egypt.</hi> Vnder the name of <hi>Greece,</hi> may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended all thoſe Countries almoſt as farre as <hi>Sclauonia</hi> or <hi>Wendenland.</hi> And though at this preſent they are in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a good part of <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> and be it granted, that ſo it may fall out; as they may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt <hi>Germanie,</hi> or other adia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Countries: yet becauſe their dominions muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to certaine bounds, and muſt not extend to compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with the <hi>Romane</hi> potencie, as we haue formerly ſhewed: it is credible that thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces ſhall not fall into their ſubiection, as thoſe three are at this day, <hi>Greece, Egypt,</hi>
                  <pb n="371" facs="tcp:15059:200"/>and <hi>Aſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They ſhall make warre with the Saints, and rage with extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of crueltie, againſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the name of Chriſt, and this their furie ſhall endure till the end of the world</hi> as <hi>Daniel</hi> clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teſtifies. And this is the maine cauſe of his Prophecie, that wee being hereby admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed and aſcertained of the calamities and miſeries of the laſt daies, ſhould not bee deie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in minde, but looke for a freedome by the comming of Chriſt our Sauiour: who will preſently, as hee himſelfe ſpeakes, take off theſe afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and tranſport his ſeruants into a fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Certaine places in <hi>Daniel,</hi>

<pb n="372" facs="tcp:15059:201"/>time (which is there ſet down and expreſſed) of the comming of the Meſſias promiſed to the Fathers. The reſt of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies belong to the worlds laſt age of all, and to thoſe that ſhall then liue: when alſo that little horne, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homets</hi> poſteritie, ſhall make warre with the Saints: <hi>and when that man of ſinne and wickedneſſe ſhall bee reuealed and diſcloſed; who ſits in the Temple of God, vaunting himſelfe as though he were God:</hi> for <hi>Daniel</hi> alſo preſignified his tyrannies,
<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2.</note> as <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles expreſly interprets.</p>
               <p>Sathan, whom Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe cals the Prince of this world, who at all times elſe, but eſpecially in the laſt age of this fading world, ſhall rage moſt of all, letting looſe the raines of all his wrath and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and ſhall ſtirre vp enemies againſt Chriſt; who ſhall not
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:15059:201"/>onely tyrannize by force of Armes, but alſo by falſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine ſeduce men into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit and errour, inſomuch that the very elect ſhall ſcarce eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape their ſnares, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.</p>
               <p>Surely this is the very time which <hi>Daniel</hi> in his twelfth chapter points at: being ſo full fraught with affliction and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitie, as neuer was before, or euer ſhall be hereafter. For he promiſes vs no ioy, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces moſt cruell perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when he ſaies, that thoſe calamities which hee ſpeakes of,
<note place="margin">Dan. 12.7.</note> ſhall indure <hi>till the ſcattering of the power of the holy people bee accompliſhed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore Gods ſeruants ſhall bee perſecuted all the world ouer, and the godly ſhall be afflicted in diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, till the end of the world: which teſtimony of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, or rather of the Angell, bereaues vs of all hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:15059:202"/>and aggregation. For he ſpeakes of a perpetuall ſcattering and diſſipation; and after that diſſentions haue ariſen about doctrine and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, then at length he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the end, when CHRIST himſelfe ſhall appeare.</p>
               <p>But to comfort, chear vp, and ſuſtaine thoſe, that ſhall then liue, preſently after thoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, he places the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the dead, which that we may finde to our ioy and comfort, wee ought with ſeruent prayers to beſeech God. And Chriſt himſelfe warrants vs for the credence wee ought to giue to <hi>Daniel,</hi> who in his ſermon rehearſes a place taken out from thence,
<note place="margin">Mat. 24. Mar. 13.</note> and commends it to his Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</p>
               <p>Thus therefore, theſe our times, being the moſt miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, we ought conſiderately to ponderate and diligently look
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:15059:202"/>into this Prophet, who prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to vs now acting the laſt ſcene vpon this worlds ſtage: that we may fortifie our ſelues, both in time of theſe preſent afflictions, as alſo againſt all imminent ſtormes and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, with true and aſſured conſolation, as with a certaine rampire and bulwarke.</p>
